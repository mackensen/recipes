## Annotated bagels

Ingredients:

- 3 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 6 3/4 teaspoons white sugar
- 2 cups warm water
- 5 1/4 cups bread flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 egg

Steps:

1. Heat 2 cups of water to 110 degrees. This will take two minutes on high.
2. Pour 3/4 cups of the water into a 1 cup measuring cup.
3. Add the sugar and the yeast to the water. After five minutes, stir the mixture to dissolve the yeast. Continue.
4. Add the bread flour and the salt to the mixer bowl. Mix manually.
5. Make a well in the middle of the mixer bowl. Add the yeast mixture.
6. Install the mixer bowl in the mixer. Lock in place. Attach the paddle.
7. Set mixer to the lowest setting, "stir." Set timer to 2 minutes.
8. While stirring, add 2/3 cup of the warm water to the edge of the mixer bowl. After 30-40 seconds, add another 1/4 cup to the edge.
9. After two minutes stop the mixer, clean the dough off the paddle, and add 1/4 cup of water to the bottom of the bowl. Stir for two more minutes.
10. Ensure dough has clumped to solid mass and does not stick to the bowl.
11. Remove the paddle from the mixer and attach the dough hook. Set mixer to "stir" and set the timer to 8 minutes.
12. Remove dough from mixer bowl, oil the bowl, and return the dough to the bowl. Manually remove imperfections. Cover mixer bowl with a towel. Wait for one hour.
13. Leave dough in the mixer bowl. "Punch down" to remove air bubbles. Let sit uncovered for 10 minutes.
14. Weigh the dough on the kitchen scale, then divide into 12 equal parts.
15. Shape dough into ball, then gently press finger into center to create a hole. Hole should be 1/2 the diameter. Press down to flatten. Have all 12 rest under towel for 10 minutes.
16. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
17. Bring large pot of water to boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to 7 1/2.
18. Beat the egg in a cup with one teaspoon of water and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
19. Cover a large cooking sheet with parchment paper.
20. For each bagel: lower into boiling water for 1 minute, flip, and boil for another minute. Do four bagels at a time. Bagels will float.
21. Place each bagel on the sheet, then brush with the egg wash. Add toppings.
22. Bake for 25-30 minutes. Bagels should be golden brown.
