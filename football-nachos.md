## Football Nachos

Ingredients:

- 1 lb lean ground beef
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp oregano leaves
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 can (14.5oz) diced tomatoes
- 1 can (4oz) diced mild green chiles
- 8oz sliced mushrooms

Steps:

1. Brown the ground beef in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Break up assiduously.
2. When it is halfway browned, add the cumin, oregano, cayenne pepper, and minced garlic. Stir.
3. When meat is fully browned, turn heat down to medium. Add the tomatoes and green chiles.
4. Optionally add mushrooms. Break them up as you did with the ground beef and stir into the mix.
5. Cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated.

### Serving option

1. Turn on the broiler and set 425 degrees F.
2. Cover a large pan with foil. Layer large restaurant-style tortilla chips over the foil. Cover the chips with the meat mixture, then layer on shredded cheese.
3. Create a second layer over top of the first, beginning with the chips.
4. Put the pan in the broiler on the lowest rack and cook for 5 minutes or until cheese has fully melted.
