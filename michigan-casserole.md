## Michigan Casserole

This recipe comes down from my mother, who I believe found it in the *Detroit Free Press* years ago. Adapted for cooked kidney beans.

### Ingredients

- 3 cups cooked red kidney beans
- 1 lb bulk sausage, mild or hot
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 large apples, cored and chopped, unpeeled
- 16 oz tomato sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard

### Steps

1. Drain the canned kidney beans and set aside the liquid.
2. Add the sausage and onions to a 4-6 quart casserole pan or Dutch oven. Cook over medium high heat. Ensure meat is broken up.
3. Once the meat is broken up and the onions browning, drain off the excess fat.
4. Add kidney beans, apples, tomato sauce, garlic, sugar, chili powder, and dry mustard. Stir until mixed.
5. Cook mixture over low heat for 60 minutes. Add the set aside liquid if the mixture dries out.
