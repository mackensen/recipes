## One-shot pasta

This is a derivative of [Pasta with Olive Oil And Garlic](http://www.food.com/recipe/pasta-with-olive-oil-and-garlic-8634), knocked down for one person.

- 1/8 lb spaghetti

(Serves one)

Steps

1. Cook the spaghetti in boiling water, adding salt.

6. Mix everything.
7. Serve with a piece of bread for the excess olive oil and basil.
