## Peasant bread

### Ingredients

- 4 cups all-purpose flour (or bread flour)
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 cups warm water
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast

### Steps

1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, sugar, and instant yeast.
2. Heat 2 cups of water to 110 degrees. This will take two minutes on high.
3. Add the water to the flour mixture; mix until the flour is absorbed.
4. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and set aside in a warm spot to rise for at least an hour.
5. Punch down the dough: use a spatula to start at the edge, go a quarter way around the outside, then turn the dough over into the center. Repeat until dough is no longer clinging to the sides and "punched down" in the center.
6. Grease a 10" x 5" bread pan.
7. Pour the dough into the bread pan and let rise uncovered for 20-30 minutes. The dough should be just below, at, or above the level of the pan.
8. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
9. Bake for 15 minutes.
10. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F. Bake for another 20 minutes.
11. Remove from the oven and let cool.
